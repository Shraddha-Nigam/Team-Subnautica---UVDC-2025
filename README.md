# UVDC 2025 – Team Subnautica

Design and system architecture of a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) developed for the Underwater Vehicle Design Challenge (UVDC) 2025 by Team Subnautica, IIT Guwahati.

Highlights:

- Sonar-based 3D mapping & SLAM in GPS-denied environments

- 8-thruster, 6-DOF vectored propulsion with redundancy

- Environmental, chemical & biological sensing (in-situ analysis, eDNA)

- Jetson AGX Orin–based control and data processing

- Fail-safe recovery with autonomous surfacing and acoustic backup

### Full technical details available in the Team Subnautica - UVDC 2025 report.
